# Topic-Modeling-Nepal-Politics

This is a script for R Shiny App running at: https://saurav-datageek.shinyapps.io/topic-modeling/?_ga=2.95674972.1147052383.1630992257-551597192.1630262256

The App performs Topic Modeling on more than 12000 Nepal Politics articles collected over the period of 2015-2020. 

The Topic Modeling is based on Latent Dirichelt Allocation (LDA) algorithm. 

The App uses R Data files separately created in R Scripts outside this current project. 

Separate Data director needed to be created inside the project folder to store R Data files so as to facilitate the smooth operation of App.

So, the general layout of project would be: Project Directory -> Data (R Data Files), ui.R, server.R
